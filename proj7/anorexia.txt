Anorexia
Anonymous

I hate the girl in the mirror
so you'll never hear me say that
I'm good enough
I know in my heart that
the number on the scale defines my worth
and that
being thin will make me happy
I refuse to believe that there is hope
I'm ashamed of my body
No longer can I say
I am worth fighting for.
